Scoping allows a service provider to specify a list of identity providers in an
authnRequest to a proxying identity provider. This is an indication to the 
proxying identity provider that the service will only deal with the identity
providers specified.

A common use is for a service provider in a hub-and-spoke architecture to 
manage its own discovery service and being able to tell the hub/proxy-IdP which 
(backend-end) identity provider to use. The standard discovery service in 
SimpleSAMLphp will show the intersection of all the known IdPs and the IdPs 
specified in the scoping element. If this intersection only contains one IdP, 
then the request is automatically forwarded to that IdP.

Scoping is a SAML 2.0 specific option.

Options
-------

SimpleSAMLphp supports scoping by allowing the following options:

`ProxyCount`
: Specifies the number of proxying indirections permissible
between the identity provider receiving the request and the identity provider 
who ultimately authenticates the user. A count of zero permits no proxying. If 
ProxyCount is unspecified the number of proxy indirections is not limited.

`IDPList`
: The list of trusted IdPs, i.e. the list of entityIDs for identity providers
that are relevant for a service provider in an authnRequest. 

### Note ###
SimpleSAMLphp does not support specifying the GetComplete option.

Usage
-----

The ProxyCount and IDPList option can be specified in the following places:

- as a state parameter to the authentication source
- in the saml:SP authentication source configuration
- in the saml20-idp-remote metadata
- in the saml20-sp-remote metadata

Example configuration:

    # Add the IDPList
    'IDPList' => array(
        'IdPEntityID1',
        'IdPEntityID2',
        'IdPEntityID3',
    ),
    
    # Set ProxyCount
    'ProxyCount' => 2,

RequesterID element
-------------------

To allow an identity provider to identify the original requester and the 
proxying identity providers, SimpleSAMLphp adds the RequesterID element to 
the request and if necessary the scoping element even if explicit scoping is 
not used.

The RequesterId elements are available from the state array as an array, for
instance the authenticate method in an authentication source

    $requesterIDs = $state['saml:RequesterID'];

AuthenticatingAuthority element
-------------------------------

To allow a service provider to identify the authentication authorities that 
were involved in the authentication of the user, SimpleSAMLphp adds the 
AuthenticatingAuthority elements.

The list of authenticating authorities (the AuthenticatingAuthority element) 
can be retrieved as an array from the authentication data.

    # Get the authentication source.
    $as = new SimpleSAML_Auth_Simple();

    # Get the AuthenticatingAuthority
    $aa = $as->getAuthData('saml:AuthenticatingAuthority');
