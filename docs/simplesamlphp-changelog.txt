## Version 1.2

Released 2008-09-26. Revision 899.

There are some changes in the configuration files from version 1.1 to 1.2. `/simplesaml/admin/config.php` should be used to check what options have changed.

When you upgrade from an previous version you should copy `authsources.php` from `config-templates` into `config` directory.

There are also some changes to the templates. If you have any custom templates, they should be updated to match the ones included. Of notable changes is that the `t(...)`-functtes, they should be updated to match the ones included. Of notable changes is that the `t(...)`-function has been simplified, and takes far fewer parameters. It is backwardscompatible, but will write a warning to the log until updated. The backwards compatibility will be removed in a future version.

    custom authentication sources, authentication processing filters
    and themes.
