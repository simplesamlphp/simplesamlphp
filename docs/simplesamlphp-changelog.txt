## Version 1.2

Released 2008-09-26. Revision 899.

There are some changes in the configuration files from version 1.1 to 1.2. `/simplesaml/admin/config.php` should be used to check what options have changed.

When you upgrade from an previous version you should copy `authsources.php` from `config-templates` into `config` directory.

There are also some changes to the templates. If you have any custom templates, they should be updated to match the ones included. Of notable changes is that the `t(...)`-functtes, they should be updated to match the ones included. Of notable changes is that the `t(...)`-function has been simplified, and takes far fewer parameters. It is backwardscompatible, but will write a warning to the log until updated. The backwards compatibility will be removed in a future version.

### New features

  * Experimental support for modules. Currently modules can contain
    custom authentication sources, authentication processing filters
    and themes.
  * An generic SQL autentication module added for those who store their
    users in an SQL database.
  * Limited support for validating against a CA root certificate. The
    current implementation only supports cases where the certificate is
    directly signed by the CA.
  * Allow an IdP to have multiple valid certificate fingerprints, to
    allow for easier updating of certificates.
  * Shibboleth 1.3 authentication for Auth MemCookie.
  * Support for link to privacy policy on consent-pages.
  * Customizable initial focus on consent-page.
  * Almost all pages should be translateable.
  * Allow SAML 2.0 SP to handle error replies from IdP.
  * PostgreSQL support for consent storage.
  * Add support for encrypted private keys.
  * Proof-of-concept MetaShare service, for easy publishing and sharing
    of metadata.


### Bug fixes

  * Fixed generated SAML 2.0 metadata to be correct.
  * Fixed logout for Auth MemCookie.
  * Sign SAML 2.0 authentication response on failure (such as
    NoPassive).
  * Fixes for IsPassive in the SAML 2.0 IdP.
  * Fix default syslog configuration on Windows.
  * Fix order of signing and encryption of SAML 2.0 responses
  * Fix generated metadata for Shib 1.3
  * Fix order of elements in encrypted assertions to be schema
    compliant.
  * Fix session index sent to SAML 2.0 SPs.
  * Remember SAML 2.0 NameID sent to SPs, and include it in logout
    requests.


## Version 1.1

Released 2008-06-19. Revision 673.

When upgrading to version 1.1 from version 1.0, you should update the configuration files. Many options have been added, and some have moved or removed. The new configuration check page: `/simplesaml/admin/config.php` may be useful for determining what should be updated. Also note that the `language.available` option in `config.php` should be updated to reflect the new languages which have been added.

There are also several changes to the template files. If you have done any customizations to these, you should test them to make sure that they still work. Some changes, such as allowing the users to save the IdP choice they make in the discovery service, will not work without updating the templates.

New localizations in version 1.1: Sami, Svenska (swedish), Suomeksi (finnish), Nederlands, Luxembourgish, Slovenian, Hrvatski (Croatian), Magyar (Hungarian).
