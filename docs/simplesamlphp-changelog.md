SimpleSAMLphp changelog
=======================

<!-- {{TOC}} -->

This document lists the changes between versions of SimpleSAMLphp.
See the upgrade notes for specific information about upgrading.

## Version 1.17.0

Released TBD

  * Introduce a new experimental user interface based on Twig templates.
    The new Twig templates co-exist next to the old ones and come
    with a new look-and-feel for SimpleSAMLphp and independent interfaces for
    users and administrators. This new interface uses also a new build system
    to generate bundled assets.
  * Introduce Symfony-style routing and dependency injection(#966).
  * Generate session IDs complying with PHP config settings when using the PHP
    session handler (#569).
  * Update OpenSSL RSA bit length in docs (#993).
  * Update all code, configuration templates and documentation to PHP
    short array syntax.
  * All classes moved to namespaces and code reformatted to PSR-2.
  * Use bcrypt for new password hashes, old ones will remain working (#996).
  * Many code cleanups.
  * Update the SAML2 library dependency to 3.2.5.
  * Update the Clipboard.JS library dependency to 2.0.4.
  * Translated to Zulu and Xhosa.
  * Multiple bug fixes and corrections.

### Interoperability
  * The minimum PHP version required is now 5.5.
  * Fixed compatibility with PHP 7.3 and HVVM.
  * SimpleSAMLphp can now be used with applications that use Twig 2 and/or Symfony 4.
  * The SAML2 library now uses getters/setters to manipulate objects properties.

### authfacebook
  * Fix facebook compatibility (query parameters).

### authorize
  * Add the possibility to configure a custom rejecttion message.

### consent
  * The module is now disabled by default.

### core
  * Allow `core:PHP` to manipulate the entire state array.
  * IdP initiated login: add compatibility with Shibboleth parameters.

### multiauth
  * Added a `preselect` configuration option to skip authsource selection (#1005).

### negotiate
  * The `keytab` setting now allows for relative paths too.

### preprodwarning
  * This module is now deprecated. Use the `production` configuration
    option instead; set it to `false` to show a pre-production warning
    before authentication.

### saml
  * Add initial support for SAML Subject ID Attributes.
  * Allow to specify multiple supported NameIdFormats in IdP hosted and SP
    remote metadata.
  * Allow to specify NameIDPolicy Format and AllowCreate in hosted SP
    and remote IdP configuration. Restore the possibility to omit it from
    AuthnRequests entirely (#984).
  * Add a `assertion.allowed_clock_skew` setting to influence how lenient
    we should be with the timestamps in received SAML messages.
  * If the Issuer of a SAML response does not match the entity we sent the
    request to, log a warning instead of bailing out with an exception.
  * Allow setting the AudienceRestriction in SAML2 requests (#998).
  * Allow disabling the Scoping element in SP and remote IdP configuration with
    the `disable_scoping` option, for compatibility with ADFS which does not
    accept the element (#985).

### sanitycheck
  * Translated into several languages.

    from _warning_ to _debug_.
  * Make the `attr` configuration option of the _negotiate_ allow both a string and an array.
  * Look for the _keytab_ file used by the _negotiate_ module in the `cert` directory, accepting
    both absolute and relative paths.

## Version 1.2

Released 2008-09-26. Revision 899.

There are some changes in the configuration files from version 1.1 to 1.2. `/simplesaml/admin/config.php` should be used to check what options have changed.

When you upgrade from an previous version you should copy `authsources.php` from `config-templates` into `config` directory.

There are also some changes to the templates. If you have any custom templates, they should be updated to match the ones included. Of notable changes is that the `t(...)`-functtes, they should be updated to match the ones included. Of notable changes is that the `t(...)`-function has been simplified, and takes far fewer parameters. It is backwardscompatible, but will write a warning to the log until updated. The backwards compatibility will be removed in a future version.

    and themes.
