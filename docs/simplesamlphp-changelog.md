:warning: IMPORTANT NOTE :warning:

Due to a mistake, this bugfix-release can turn out to become a backwards-incompatibility for those who override the loginuserpass.twig in their custom theme.
Please update your theme to reflect the changes in [this commit](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/pull/2022/commits/691199e9b963a2861d731e6583555c7a8df39992) before updating.

  many lightly configured installations will have it enabled by default. Please check your
