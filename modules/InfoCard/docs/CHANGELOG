We are glad to announce  a new release of the InfoCard
module implementation for simpleSAMLphp.

Sorry for being a bit late but I've just finished my degree exams.

Here are the major changes:
-In addition to user-password authentication, STS is also accepting Self-issued cards.
-Fully compatible with MS Cardspace. Really! (Tested with Digitalme
and Cardspaces)
-mex.php has been fully rewritten, now it's short and understable. :)
-I've added a link in the module main page so it's possible to get a
managed card  once you get authenticated by means of a simple user-password form. Because of this getinfocard.php is replaced by getcardform.php
-A new classs called STS has been added to handle the STS messages
(issuing InfoCards, Request Service Token Response, Error Response).
-tokenservice.php make use of STS class. This has allowed us to shorten it quite a log.
-Commented and more elegant code.
-Logging support:It's possible to log the RST (from the identity selector) and the RSTR (from the STS) messages in a configurable directory.
-We carry on using transport binding for the communications.

This work is being supported by RedIRIS (the spanish NREN, www.rediris.es) and CS Department of the University of Alcala (Spain).

This modules has been developed by Samuel Mu√±oz Hidalgo.
