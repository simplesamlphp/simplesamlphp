A-Select module for simpleSAMLphp
---------------------------------

This module allows one to use an A-Select server as authentication
source for simpleSAMLphp.

The module supports the A-Select protocol, including signing of
requests. Not supported is A-Select Cross.

Usage:

Enable the module if not already enabled:
$ touch modules/aselect/enabled

In config/authsources.php, configure your A-Selectserver as an
authentication source. The following is an example for a source
named 'aselect':

    'aselect' => array(
        'aselect:aselect',
        'app_id' => 'simplesamlphp',
        'server_id' => 'sso.example.com',
        'server_url' => 'https://test.sso.example.com/server',
        'private_key' => 'file:///etc/ssl/private/aselect.key'
    ),

The parameters:
- app_id: the application I for simpleSAMLphp as configured in
  your A-Select server;
- server_id: the A-Select server ID as configured in your
  A-Select server;
- server_url: the URL for your A-Selectserver, usually ends in
  '/server/.
- private_key: the key you want to use for signing requests.
  If you're really sure you do not want request signing, you
  can set this option to a null value.
Options 'serverurl' and 'serverid' (without underscore) are
supported for backwards compatibility.
