## Configure your logs

Reccomended to use syslog for logging. Then a separate loglevel is
dedicated to statistics. You need to get all statistics log entries
in one log file. Here is how I do it in syslog.conf:

    # SimpleSAMLphp logging
    local5.*                        /var/log/simplesamlphp.log
    # Notice level is reserved for statistics only...
    local5.=notice                  /var/log/simplesamlphp.stat

Then make sure you have configured this correctly such that you
have one log file like this:

    # ls -la /var/log/simplesamlphp.stat
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 76740 Nov 15 13:37 /var/log/simplesamlphp.stat

With content that looks like this:

    # tail /var/log/simplesamlphp.stat
    Nov 15 12:01:49 www1 simplesamlphp-foodle[31960]: 5 STAT [77013b4b6e] saml20-sp-SSO urn:mace:feide.no:services:no.feide.foodle sam.feide.no andreas@uninett.no
    Nov 15 13:01:14 www1 simplesamlphp-openwiki[2247]: 5 STAT [50292b9d04] saml20-sp-SSO urn:mace:feide.no:services:no.feide.openwikicore sam.feide.no NA
    Nov 15 13:16:39 www1 simplesamlphp-openwiki[2125]: 5 STAT [3493d5d87f] saml20-sp-SSO urn:mace:feide.no:services:no.feide.openwikicore sam.feide.no NA
    Nov 15 13:37:27 www1 simplesamlphp-foodle[3146]: 5 STAT [77013b4b6e] AUTH-login-admin OK

Here you can see that I collect statistics in one file for several installations. You could easily separate each instance of simpleSAMLphp into separate files (your preference).

## Configure the statistics module

First enable the statistics module, as you enable any other module:

    cd modules/statistics
    touch enable

Then take the configuration template:

    cp modules/statistics/config-templats/*.php config/

Configure the path of the log file:

	'inputfile' => '/tmp/stat',

Make sure the stat dir is writable. SimpleSAMLphp will write data here:

	'statdir' => '/tmp/stats/',

### Configuring the syntax of the logfile

Syslog uses different date formats on different environments, so you need to do some manual tweaking to make sure that simpleSAMLphp knows how to interpret the logs.

There is three parameter values you need to make sure is correct.

	'datestart'  => 1,
	'datelength' => 15,
	'offsetspan' => 21,

The first `datestart` is 1 when the date start from the begginning of the line. The `datelength` parameter tells how many character long the date is.

The `offsetspan` parameter shows on which character the first column starts, such that the STAT keyword becomes in column number 3.

Use the `loganalyzer` script with the `--debug` parameter to debug whether your configuration is correct. Then it easy to see what is wrong. In example if the STAT keyword is not in column 3.

Here is example output:


	$ cd modules/statistics/bin
	$ ./loganalyzer.php --debug
	Statistics directory   : /tmp/stats/
	Input file             : /Users/andreas/Desktop/simplesamlphp.log
	Offset                 : 4237200
	----------------------------------------
	Log line: Feb 11 11:32:57 moria-app1 syslog_moria-app1[6630]: 5 STAT [2d41ee3f1e] AUTH-login-admin Failed
	Date parse [Feb 11 11:32:57] to [Wed, 11 Feb 09 11:32:57 +0100]
	Array
	(
		[0] => moria-app1
		[1] => syslog_moria-app1[6630]:
		[2] => 5
		[3] => STAT
		[4] => [2d41ee3f1e]
		[5] => AUTH-login-admin
		[6] => Failed
	)

In the debug output, please verify four things:

 1. That the first field in the date parse line contains all the characters that are part of the timestamp, compare with the log line on the line above.
 2. Verify that the second field in the date parse line is correct - corresponding to the input timestamp.
 3. That the first `[0]` field contains all the characters from the first column.
 4. That column `[3]` is STAT.


### Setup cron

You also should setup the cron module:

    cd modules/cron
    touch enable

### Alternatively to use the cron module

Alternatively to use the cron module you can run the
script`statistics/bin/loganalyzer.php`.

## Presentation of the statistics

At the installation page there will be a link "show statitics", go there and if simpleSAMLphp finds the statistics files in the `statdir` generated from cron or the script you will see statistics. Enjoy.
