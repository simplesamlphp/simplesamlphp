`core:WarnShortSSOInterval`
===========================

Give a warning to the user when authenticating twice in a short time.
This is mainly intended to prevent redirect loops between the IdP and the SP.


Example
-------

    'authproc' => [
        50 => [
            'class' => 'core:WarnShortSSOInterval',
        ],
    ],
